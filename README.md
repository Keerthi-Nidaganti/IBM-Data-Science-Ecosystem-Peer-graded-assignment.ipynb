IBM/Coursera Peer-graded Assignment - Data Science Ecosystem
Assignment Topic: I was given an empty Jupyterlite notebook which I launched in the course, to complete this assignment. I needed to include a combination of markdown and code cells. Guidelines for the submission:
There are a total of 25 points possible for this final project, based on the following Exercises: 

(1 pt) - Exercise 2: Create a markdown cell with the title of the notebook
(1 pt) - Exercise 3 - Create a markdown cell for an introduction. 
(1 pt) - Exercise 4 - Create a markdown cell to list data science languages. 
(3 pts) - Exercise 5 - Create a markdown cell to list data science libraries. 
(3 pts) - Exercise 6 - Create a markdown cell with a table of Data Science tools. 
(3 pts) - Exercise 7 - Create a markdown cell introducing arithmetic expression examples. 
(1 pt) - Exercise 8 - Create a code cell to multiply and add numbers. 
(2 pts) - Exercise 9 - Create a code cell to convert minutes to hours. 
(2 pts) - Exercise 10 -Insert a markdown cell to list Objectives. 
(3 pts) - Exercise 11 - Create a markdown cell to indicate the Authorâ€™s name. 
(3 pts) - Exercise 12 - Share your notebook through the GitHub URL 
(3 pts) - Exercise 13 - Take a screenshot of the first page of the notebook


# Data Science Tools and Ecosystem
In this notebook, Data Science Tools and Ecosystems are summarized.
**Objectives:**

- List commonly used libraries used by Data Scientists.
- Comment on Data Science tools.

Some of the popular languages that Data Scientists use are:
1. Python
2. R
3. SQL
4. Java
5. C/C++
6. JavaSc
Some of the commonly used libraries used by Data Scientists include:
1. Pandas
2. Numpy
3. Matplotlib
4. Keras
5. Scikit-learn
6. Tensorflow
7. PyTorch
8. Seaborn

#  Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python:
# Constant Expressions
x = 15 + 1.3

print(x)
# Result 16.3
# Arithmetic Expressions 
x = 40
y = 12

add = x + y 
sub = x - y 
pro = x * y 
div = x / y 

print(add) 
print(sub) 
print(pro) 
print(div)
# Result 
52
28
480
3.3333333333333335

#This a simple arithmetic expression to multiply and then add integers
(3*4)+5
# Result 17
#This will convert 200 minutes to hours by diving by 60
200/60
# Result 3.3333333333333335
